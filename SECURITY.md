# Security Guidelines

## Private Key Management

### Storage
- **Never store private keys in code or configuration files**
- Use environment variables only for development/testing
- Consider encrypted storage for production deployments
- Use hardware security modules (HSMs) for high-value operations

### Validation
- All private keys are validated on startup
- Invalid keys cause immediate application termination
- Key format must be base58-encoded Solana keypair (64 bytes)

### Logging
- Private keys are never logged
- Public keys (wallet addresses) are safe to log
- Sensitive data is automatically redacted from logs

## Environment Variables

### Required Secrets
```bash
PRIVATE_KEY=<base58_encoded_keypair>        # Trading wallet private key
XAI_API_KEY=<xai_api_key>                   # Grok API access
BIRDEYE_API_KEY=<birdeye_api_key>          # Price data API
TELEGRAM_TOKEN=<bot_token>                  # Optional: Telegram notifications
```

### Database Security
```bash
MONGO_URI=mongodb://user:pass@host:port/db  # Use authentication
```

### Network Security
```bash
SOLANA_RPC=https://secure-rpc-endpoint.com  # Use HTTPS endpoints
```

## Operational Security

### Dry Run Mode
- Always test new strategies in dry-run mode first
- Use `--dry-run` flag to simulate trades without spending SOL
- Validate configuration and connectivity before live trading

### Risk Limits
- Set conservative daily spending limits
- Configure circuit breakers for consecutive failures
- Monitor slippage protection thresholds
- Review and adjust risk parameters regularly

### Monitoring
- Enable structured logging for audit trails
- Monitor database for unusual trade patterns
- Set up alerts for system errors and performance issues
- Review correlation IDs for request tracing

## Network Security

### RPC Endpoints
- Use authenticated RPC endpoints when possible
- Prefer self-hosted nodes for better security and performance
- Implement rate limiting and request timeouts
- Monitor RPC endpoint health and failover capabilities

### API Keys
- Rotate API keys regularly
- Use least-privilege access for external services
- Monitor API usage and quotas
- Implement proper error handling for authentication failures

## Database Security

### MongoDB Configuration
- Enable authentication and authorization
- Use TLS/SSL for connections
- Implement proper backup and recovery procedures
- Regular security updates and patches

### Data Protection
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Implement proper index strategies for performance
- Regular database maintenance and monitoring
- Audit database access logs

## Deployment Security

### Container Security
- Use official base images and keep them updated
- Run containers as non-root users
- Implement proper secrets management
- Scan images for vulnerabilities

### Process Isolation
- Run the bot in isolated environments
- Limit system permissions and network access
- Implement proper logging and monitoring
- Use process managers for automatic restarts

## Development Security

### Code Security
- Regular dependency updates and security scans
- Use static analysis tools (e.g., bandit, safety)
- Implement proper error handling and input validation
- Regular code reviews and security audits

### Testing
- Include security test cases
- Test error conditions and edge cases
- Validate input sanitization and output encoding
- Test with minimal privileges

## Incident Response

### Preparation
- Document emergency procedures
- Maintain contact information for key personnel
- Prepare incident response playbooks
- Regular backup and recovery testing

### Detection
- Monitor logs for suspicious activities
- Set up alerts for critical system events
- Implement anomaly detection for trading patterns
- Regular security assessments

### Response
- Immediate isolation of compromised systems
- Secure evidence collection and analysis
- Communication with stakeholders
- System recovery and lessons learned

## Compliance Considerations

### Financial Regulations
- Understand local regulations for automated trading
- Implement proper record keeping and audit trails
- Consider regulatory reporting requirements
- Consult with legal experts for compliance guidance

### Data Protection
- Understand data privacy regulations (GDPR, CCPA, etc.)
- Implement proper data handling and retention policies
- Provide data access and deletion capabilities
- Regular privacy impact assessments

## Best Practices

### Development
- Follow secure coding practices
- Use version control with proper access controls
- Implement CI/CD with security checks
- Regular security training for developers

### Operations
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular security updates and patches
- Implement proper change management
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing

### Monitoring
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring
- Real-time alerting for security events
- Regular log analysis and threat hunting
- Incident response planning and testing
